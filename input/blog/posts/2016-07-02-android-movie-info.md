For the [Developing Android Apps][android-udacity] course on Udacity, I
have made an app that displays information about popular and top-rated
movies. It gets this information in JSON format from [The Movie DB][tmdb]. This
app also shows details about specific movies, and allows the user to mark
favorites. You can find the source code, and an APK, [on GitHub][github-source].

Here are some screenshots:
