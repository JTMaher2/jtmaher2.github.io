<p>
    I am James T. Maher, a computer support specialist who lives in Illinois and Wisconsin, USA. I have a bachelor's degree in computer science from <a href="https://www.northcentralcollege.edu">North Central College</a> in Naperville, IL. I currently work for <a href="https://www.createasoft.com">CreateASoft, Inc.</a> in Aurora, IL. I like anything related to providing support for mobile, desktop or web apps based on the Microsoft stack (e.g. C#, VB.NET, .NET Framework, .NET Core, UWP, Xamarin, ASP.NET MVC, SQL Server, IIS, DNN and Statiq.Web). When I am not providing support, I like to do physically active things like running, playing tennis and hiking. I also like playing and composing music, specifically classical piano.<br/>
